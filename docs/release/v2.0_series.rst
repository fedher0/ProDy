2.0.1 (Dec 20, 2021)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**New Features**:
  
  * Added :function:`.calcRWSIP` for comparing sets of modes

  * New methods to convert :class:`.Atom`, :class:`.Atomic` and :class:`.EMDMAP` 
  to TEMPy objects, allowing calculations such as cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) 
  to EM maps.

  * Added :func:`.calcDynamicFlexibilityIndex` and :func:`.calcDynamicCouplingIndex`
  for further interpretation of PRS results.

  * Reinstated the option of using forces in PRS as in ProDy v1.8 (`turbo=**False**`)

  * Added GitHub Actions Continuous Integration in place of Travis. 

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**:
  
  * Compatibility and bug fixes for various functions, including pyparsing for selections.

  * Extended :class:`.AdaptiveANM` to work with other models including explicit membrane 
  ANM, :class:`.exANM`.

  * Improved capabilities for fetching and parsing mmCIF and EMD files.

  * Improved handling of residue and serial numbers including hexadecimal and hybrid36 formats.

  * Consistency fixes.

  * More non-standard amino acids (MEN, CSB, CME).
